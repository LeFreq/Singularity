SINCE GIT doesn't have an annotate file function to describe the purpose of every file, every file should have a header like so:

#Purpose:  what this file does
#Needs: what it might ask from the system
#Publishes: what it gives to the system
#Donewhen:  what state tells that this file or function`s purpose is completed
