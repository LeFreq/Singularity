SINCE GIT doesn't have an annotate file function to describe the purpose of every file, every file should have a header like so:

#Purpose:  what this file does (".." means:  should be obvious by file name)
#Needs: what it might ask from the system
#Publishes: what it gives to the system
#Donewhen:  what state tells that this file or function`s purpose is completed

Follow Zen Code guidelines.  See the Pangaia project wiki (@github) for several coding philosophies and guidelines for architecting code.

Otherwise:
For code comments, user something like:
### FIXMEs (add two slashes (//) for C)
## WARNs
# regular INFO/comments
